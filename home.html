      <p>“The greatness of a person is not in how much wealth they acquire, but in their integrity and their ability to affect those around them positively. We rise by lifting others, and through acts of kindness and service, we leave a mark on the world that is far greater than any material achievement.</p>
      <p>Remember, true leaders do not create followers, they create more leaders. You are capable of greatness, of overcoming challenges, and of inspiring change. Like Dr. Dorothy Irene Height, may you always stand firm for what is right, and never underestimate the power you hold to shape your future and the future of others.”</p>
      <p>Also, trust me this life is more spiritual than physical and I don't know about you but as for me putting God first is essencial for any achievement. </p>
